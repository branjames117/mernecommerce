# MERN eCommerce Udemy Course

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and follows Brad Traversy's MERN eCommerce From Scratch course on Udemy.com, which I will eventually turn into a virtual trading card storefront and beef up the security as practice for future eCommerce projects.

## Startup

After cloning the repository you can run the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000 with:

### `npm start`

Alternatively, to build the app for production prior to deployment:

### `npm run build`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
